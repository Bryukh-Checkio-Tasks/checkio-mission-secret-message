    How to hide a message and send it without addresses?
    You can use newspapers. Even if someone will find that occasionally we can say that is paranoia and conspiracy
    theory.
    The simplest way to hide a message is to use capital letters.
    Let's find these messages.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a text. Gather all capital letters in one word in the order how they appear in the text.
</p>
<p>
    For example: text =
    "<strong>H</strong>ow are you? <strong>E</strong>h, ok. <strong>L</strong>ow or <strong>L</strong>ower?
    <strong>O</strong>hhh.",
    if we will gather all letters, then we get "HELLO".
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text as a string (unicode).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The secret message as a string or an empty string.
</p>


<div class="for_info_only">

    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
find_message("Рow are you? Уh, ok. Low or Lower? Ohhh.") == "HELLO"
find_message("hello world!") == ""
    </pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a simple exercise to work with strings: iterate, recognize and concatenate.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    0 &lt; len(text) &le; 1000
